      Western Ghats in Kerala are a UNESCO World Heritage Site and home to rich biodiversity.
      Most of Kerala, whose native habitat consists of wet evergreen rainforests at lower elevations and highland deciduous
      and semi-evergreen forests in the east, is subject to a humid tropical climate.
      However, significant variations in terrain and elevation have resulted in a land whose biodiversity registers as
      among the world's most significant. Most of Kerala's significantly biodiverse tracts of wilderness lie in the
      evergreen forests of its easternmost districts.</p>
